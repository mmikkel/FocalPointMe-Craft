# FocalPoint Me! plugin for Craft CMS

FocalPoint Me! improves the Craft authoring experience by doing two things related to assets and focal points:     

1. Inline focal point editing is added to the image preview (i.e. thumbnail) in asset slideouts
2. The old behavior for thumbnails in asset fields is restored (i.e. double-click to open slideout; single-click-n-drag to re-order)

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 4.0.2 or later.

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require mmikkel/focal-point-me

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for FocalPoint Me!.
